- Implement a heartbeat for Iris to see if a client is still connected
- Change logging to not use the same thread anymore
- Change logging to make the call to a debug log constexpr implicitly
- Implement better way to have a single space to store Iris address and port
- Pick consistent code style (camel case, underscores etc)
- In base_connection_manager, we copy the message to send in sendMessage twice to add message size and copy the data. We can turn this into a zero copy by sending two messages: first one with the size and type and then the message itself. TCP stream ensures it can be read as a single message. To not get two calls to send() and get 2 context switches to kernel space, we can use an io_uring instance.
- Clients can currently crash iris_server pretty easily by sending nonsense; the server should instead disconnect such clients and continue its own business.
